# chameleon-dark-syntax theme

Atom syntax theme for HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, SCSS, JavaScript and JSON. It is a syntax theme only, and will not affect the Atom UI (it works with both the Light UI scheme, and Dark UI scheme). Recommended using with Seti UI.

### Installation

Run the following command:

```sh
apm install chameleon-dark-syntax
```

Then go to `Atom > Preferences > Themes` and in the `Syntax Themes` dropdown, select `Chameleon Dark` from the list.
