# chameleon-dark-syntax theme

Atom syntax theme for HTML, CSS, LESS, SASS, SCSS, JavaScript and JSON. It is a syntax theme only, and will not affect the Atom UI (it works with both the Light UI scheme, and Dark UI scheme). Recommended using with <a href="https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui">Seti UI</a>.

### Installation

```sh
apm install chameleon-dark-syntax
